  *Curtain up!* is an urban scenography workshop that explores some of the
  underused public spaces in the city of Lugano.

  In a social context that struggles for the creation of spaces dedicated to independent culture, the workshop uses the scenographic device of the curtain and poetic text as tools for observation, critique, and action.\

  From September 5 to 10, 2025, participants explored and mapped a variety of urban spaces, some of which were later crossed and animated by a specially made curtain.
