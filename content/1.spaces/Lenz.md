description: Lenz is a play based on the homonymous novel by Georg Büchner. Lenz
  is a fugitive. He walks to flee a torn world, at once too big and too small.
  His lucidity turns to madness, and this madness into disenchantment. In this
  adaptation, the story is told by two women who sheltered Lenz during his
  delirium, and whose lives were disrupted for a moment. Throughout the
  narration, Lenz's madness seems to overwhelm them. The stage design dialogues
  with the existing space, reproducing certain elements of the auditorium and
  blurring the line between the real and the fake.
