  Lenz is a play based on the homonymous novel by Georg Büchner. 

  Lenz is a fugitive. He walks to flee a torn world, at once too big and too
  small. His lucidity turns to madness, and this madness into disenchantment. In
  this adaptation, the story is told by two women who sheltered Lenz during his
  delirium, and whose lives were disrupted for a moment. 

  Throughout the narration, Lenz’s madness seems to overwhelm them. 

  The stage design dialogues with the existing space, reproducing certain
  elements of the auditorium and blurring the line between the real and the
  fake.
