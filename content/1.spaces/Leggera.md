description: Leggera is an event scenography practice based on the reuse and
  revaluation of textiles. Ephemeral and sustainable, it proposes informal and
  elegant installations, in an attempt to reduce volume and material waste. As
  well as an encounter between a designer and a scenographer, Leggera is an
  evolving laboratory for creative experimentation.
