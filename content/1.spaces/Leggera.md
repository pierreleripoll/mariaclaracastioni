  Leggera is an event scenography practice that focuses on the reuse and
  revaluation of textiles. It is both ephemeral and sustainable, proposing
  installations that are informal yet elegant. This approach is driven by an
  attempt to reduce volume and material waste.
  Leggera also represents an encounter between a designer and a scenographer,
  serving as an evolving laboratory for creative experimentation.
