description: Genius loci is a personal project created for the collective
  exhibition Le génie du lieu, in a former pharmacy that has been transformed
  into an art space. The work interrogates the environment, focusing on the
  irregularities of the architecture and on the traces of the space’s past life.
  The intervention analyses and catalogues these traces, reproducing them almost
  imperceptibly in pencil and gouache drawings on certain walls.
